Role:
I discovered that my new role in life is not just to be another csb student but to be a professional game designer. I know that I lack experience which is why now Is the perfect time to learn and to answer my responsibility as a programmer and game designer by contributing to the community.  I can do this by sharing codes or ding my duties/work so that in the future  can contribute more than just mere codes.

Relationship:
	A new world means new possibilities. This also means a whole new group of friends and acquaintances. These are some of them and I hope I make many more: “Mayor Jay”, “Daddy Blu”, Karl, JM, Jeremy, Jerick, Francisco, Amir, Jeff, Baldo, Bibi, Tyler, Charm, Eloisa, Chen, Eskarlan, Ralp, Jonas Rhian, Martin,  Dmit, Noe, Alejandro, Abboc, Gomez,  TJ, Arvin, Yao, Bordo etc.

Routine:
	My usual routine would probably be the same as others since I just go with the flow. Amazingly that all changed since the start of college I even have to study during lunch breaks. I also have to borrow books in advance since it is easy to lose valuable sources of information when you are competing against other students for the same book. I used to also play every weekend but now I can’t even lay down in the house without receiving another assignment.

Assumption:
	Although I already assumed all of these changes it is still different when you feel it for the first time. Judging from our first 2 classes in CSBLIFE I assume it will only get harder but all the more rewarding.
